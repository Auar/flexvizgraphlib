Ok, we've published the source of our demo application. You can access it
[http://flexvizgraphlib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/RelationNavigatorDemo/bin/srcview/index.html here] using the source-viewer (also provides download) and of course through
the SVN repository.

In order for the Demo application to build and run, you also need to download
a small library package (2 SWC files) which is available
[http://flexvizgraphlib.googlecode.com/files/demosupportlibs.zip here] in
the download section.

There is a lot of AS code in the demo application to handle
the various layouters, etc. The heart is the VisualGraph
component, which is (as being derived from Canvas) a UIComponent
that can just be easily included in the layout.
