<p id=""><font size="2"></font></p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">BirdEye is an Adobe AIR showcase 
application to demonstrate an open source visualization library known as Visual 
Graph.<br><br>The Flex Visual Graph Library is a community project to advance 
the design and development of an open source data visualization library and 
component suite for Adobe Flex/AIR. The actionscript-based library enables users 
to create complex data visualization interfaces for the analysis of relational 
data sets such as social networks, organization trees, navigation systems, 
taxonomies, db schemas, and other link-based phenomena. The library is purposely 
extendable and provides for separation of base, interface, and layout code. 
Additional layout algorithms can be readily integrated as an extended class 
containing only the mathematical calculations and controls needed specifically 
for the layout.<br><br>For more information and access to the library, the 
project is hosted at:<br></font><a href="http://code.google.com/p/flexvizgraphlib/"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">http://code.google.com/p/flexvizgraphlib/</font></a></FONT>
