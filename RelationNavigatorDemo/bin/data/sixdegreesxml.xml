Good planning and management are essential to package and successfully distribute a release, and to manage the associated impact and risks to the business and IT. The release of affected information systems, infrastructure, services and documentation should be planned with the business.
All associated updates to documentation should be included in the release, e.g. business processes, support documents and service level agreements.
The impact of all new or changed configuration items required to effect the authorized changes should be assessed.
The service provider should ensure that both technical and non technical aspects of the release are considered together.
The release items should be traceable and secure from modification. Only suitably tested and approved releases should be accepted into the live environment.

The release and roll out should be planned in stages as details of the roll out might not be known initially.
The planning for a release and roll out should typically include:
a) release dates and description of deliverables;
b) related changes, problems and known errors closed or resolved by this release and known errors that have been identified during testing of the release;
c) related processes to implement a release across all business and geographical units;
