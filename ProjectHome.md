## Important News ##

We migrated the code from all active projects from here to the parent project: [BirdEye](http://code.google.com/p/birdeye/) - an information visualization library.

The URL for the new site is: [http://code.google.com/p/birdeye/](http://code.google.com/p/birdeye/)

All relevant code from flexvizgraphlib went into the [RaVis](http://code.google.com/p/birdeye/wiki/RaVis) module in BirdEye.

Detailed information what happened and how it will affect you was announced in the project's google group: [http://groups.google.com/group/flexvizgraphlib](http://groups.google.com/group/flexvizgraphlib). (Join if you are not a member, yet. All important communication happens there.)

The article explaining the migration is [here](http://groups.google.com/group/flexvizgraphlib/browse_thread/thread/b5dc636d011db275) (I hope the link will not change).
